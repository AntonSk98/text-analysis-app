Maybe it's a little early for this group, but if anyone else is waiting we can share thoughts, feelings, and experiences. We plan to start late Aug early Sept for retrieval about Sept 9.

/post/a74640641/era-yes-or-no,https://community.babycenter.com/groups/a6700385,I need some opinion,"  Hi Ladies, I wanted your opinion on ERA test. just got the news that only 1 embryo came back PGS normal (2 IVF  (in vitro fertilization) cycle out of 7 blasts total). last time I had 0 out of 2 so there was no transfer. Im so ready to move to the next step that I just want to try, but then again I'm concerned since I only have one. Never implanted no MC  (miscarriage) in my past. Thanks  ","<p> <p>Hi Ladies, I wanted your opinion on ERA test. just got the news that only 1 embryo came back PGS normal (2 IVF <span class=""show_acronym""> <em>(in vitro fertilization)</em></span> cycle out of 7 blasts total). last time I had 0 out of 2 so there was no transfer.
